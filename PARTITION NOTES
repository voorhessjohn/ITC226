--create partition function and partition schema
use EmployeePartition

Create partition function fx_HireDate(Date) --emplyee table tells us the data type (date, not datetime)
As range left --outer leftmost date (range right would be the starting date) Range left is the termination date(?) The following would have worked better with RANGE RIGHT
for values('19941231','19991231','20041231','20091231') --YOu have to have one less date in the values than in the partitions for overflow. 5 groups, 4 partitions

--partition schema
Create partition Scheme sch_HireDate
As partition fx_HireDate
To(Employees1995Group,Employees2000Group,Employees2005Group,Employees2010Group,Employees2015Group)

--Copy (script to clipboard and paaste) Employee Table from MetroAlt.  Erase all of the extra stuff and take the identity (1,1) OUT. Create the same ON THE PARTITION SCHEMA (sch_HireDate)
