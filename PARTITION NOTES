--create partition function and partition schema
use EmployeePartition

Create partition function fx_HireDate(Date) --emplyee table tells us the data type (date, not datetime)
As range left --outer leftmost date (range right would be the starting date) Range left is the termination date(?) The following would have worked better with RANGE RIGHT
for values('19941231','19991231','20041231','20091231') --YOu have to have one less date in the values than in the partitions for overflow. 5 groups, 4 partitions
