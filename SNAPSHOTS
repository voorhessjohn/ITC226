/*DESCRIPTION OF CRITERION
The snapshot reflects the makeup of the database at a specific point. Subsequent additions to the database 
are not apparent in queries to the snapshot. It is a copy of the database at a moment in time. 
Any changes that are made in the underlying database are not reflected in the snapshot. 
The 'MetroAltSnapshot' references the original database, so all queries go through the underlying database. 
It does not actuall ycopy any data unless the underlying data changes*/
